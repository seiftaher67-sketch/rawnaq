# TODO: Adjust Price Positioning in Return Request Page

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Remove justify-between from the product item container to group elements closer together
- [x] Move the price display inside the product details div (text-right flex-1), after the quantity information
- [x] Adjust price styling: place currency image before price number, set textAlign to 'right', remove minWidth and unnecessary margins for RTL alignment
- [x] Test the page layout to ensure price is positioned inward as intended
